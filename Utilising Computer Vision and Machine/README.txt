This folder contains the source code for the application. In order to for the application to run properly, the app folder must be placed inside the 'examples' - 'tutorial api python folder' in a successful CMAKE build of OpenPose as per the installation instructions on the website: https://cmu-perceptual-computing-lab.github.io/openpose/web/html/doc/md_doc_installation_0_index.html

The models were trained in jupyter notebook and an example for one of the models is attached. All models use a similar architecture, only changing the num features and input datasets. The actual datasets are not included due to file size constraints, but the scripts used to create them are included. Such scripts must be placed into the 'tutorial api python' folder in a successful CMAKE build of OpenPose as per the installation instructions on the website: https://cmu-perceptual-computing-lab.github.io/openpose/web/html/doc/md_doc_installation_0_index.html
